{{{
#some-id{
     position: relative;
     top: 10px;
     left: 10px;
}

}}}

== Values ==

  * `static` - the default value, element will ignore any position property ( `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`, and `z-index`) declarations
  * `relative` - element will be positioned relative to where it would have normally been in the document flow. (e.g. `left: 10px;` will position it 10 pixels to the left of where it would have been)
  * `absolute` - element will be positioned relative to its containing block element (e.g. `left: 10px;` will position it 10 pixels to the left of its containing element's left border)
  * `fixed` - element will be positioned relative to the browser canvas (e.g. `left: 10px;` will position it 10 pixels to the left of the left browser window border)
  * `inherit` - position is not inherited by default, this will force inheritance.
