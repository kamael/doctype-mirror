There has been quite a lot of confusion about computed style vs. cascaded style.  The [http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/ W3C DOM Level 2 Style specification] defines a `window.getComputedStyle` method, which calculates a single style property after all CSS stylesheets, inline styles, and user-defined CSS overrides have been taken into account.  This is called the "computed style."  The computed value is what the browser actually renders in a fixed units like `42px`, `rgb(255, 255, 255)` or `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`, `block`, and so forth.

[BrowserFamilyMSIE Microsoft Internet Explorer] does not support the `window.getComputedStyle` method, but it supports a `node.currentStyle` property.  The `node.currentStyle` property resolves all the `inherit` values until it finds an value, but it does not "compute" the actual value in pixels (or color, or whatever fixed units are appropriate).  This is called the "cascaded style."

To explain the difference, consider the following CSS and HTML:

{{{
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#a {
  width: 200px;
  background: red;
}

#b {
  width: 50%;
  background: yellow;
}

#c {
  width: inherit;
  background: green;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="a">a
  <div id="b">b
    <div id="c">c</div>
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
}}}

Here are the values for the cascaded and computed values for a, b and c:

||                || a       || b       || c      ||
|| Computed style || "200px" || "100px" || "50px" ||
|| Cascaded style || "200px" || "50%"   || "50%"  ||
