== Attributes ==

Common attributes:

  * [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/shapes.html#PolylineElementPointsAttribute points] - a comma- or space-separated list of x,y coordinates for each line segment.  This list must contain an even number of points.
  * [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/painting.html#StrokeProperty stroke] - describes how the outline of the polyline should be painted, see [SVGStrokeProperties]. The default value is "none".
  * [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/painting.html#FillProperty fill] - describes how the interior of the polyline should be painted, see [SVGFillProperties].  The default value is "black".  This attribute is not typically used with a polyline, since polylines are not closed.  See the [SVGPolygonElement polygon] element.
