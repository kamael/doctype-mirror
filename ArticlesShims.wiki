#summary Creating libraries that extend web browsers.

= Introduction =

Shims are cross-browser !JavaScript libraries that help extend web browsers with new functionality or help bring standards to existing web browsers that don't natively support them. Example shims might include libraries to help bring [SVGElements SVG] (Scalable Vector Graphics) to Internet Explorer using Flash and Microsoft Behaviors; bringing the Canvas API to IE using VML under the covers; or providing a client-side storage API for !JavaScript using Flash's !LocalStorage API. Many times these libraries will internally use proprietary technologies such as Flash, VML, Microsoft Behaviors, or Silverlight in order to do their work. Creating these libraries has been a bit of a black art with little documentation; this page is meant to provide HOWTOs on creating these, including tricks of the trade when bridging into various proprietary technologies.
