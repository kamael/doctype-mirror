== Usage ==

First introduced in XHTML 2.0, the `section` element is inconsistently supported in major browsers.  In theory, it should be simple to use `<section>` instead of a generic block-level element like `<div class=section>`.  For example:

{{{
<section>
<h1>Welcome to Initech</h1>
<p>This is our <span>home page</span>.</p>
</section>
}}}

And you would expect the DOM to look something like this (omitting text nodes for carriage returns):

{{{
section
|
+--h1 (child of section)
|  |
|  +--text node "Welcome to Initech"
|
+--p (child of section, sibling of h1)
   |
   +--text node "This is our "
   |
   +--span
   |  |
   |  +--text node "home page"
   |
   +--text node "."
}}}

Unfortunately, IE does not natively recognize the `section` element, so the elements that you would expect to be children of the `section` element are actually siblings, and the `section` element appears in the DOM as an empty node.

{{{
section (no children)
h1 (sibling of section)
|
+--text node "Welcome to Initech"
p (sibling of h1)
|
+--text node "This is our "
|
+--span
|  |
|  +--text node "home page"
|
+--text node "."
}}}
