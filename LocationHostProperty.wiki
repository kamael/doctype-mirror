== Values ==

`location.host` is hostname + port number, separated by a colon (i.e. `hostname:port`). When the port property is null, the host property is the same as the [LocationHostnameProperty hostname property].

If the location comes from an frame, reading this variable may throw an exception if the domains are different.

The `location.host` property returns a string.

This property is read/write.
