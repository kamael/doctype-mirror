`rel="alternate"` is one of several [LinkTypes link types] for describing relationships between documents.

== Usage ==

In conjunction with the [LinkMediaAttribute media] attribute, it points to an alternate representation formatted for a different [LinkMediaTypes medium].

In conjunction with the [LinkHreflangAttribute hreflang] attribute, it points to a translation.

In conjunction with the [LinkTypeAttribute type] attribute, it points to an alternate document format, such as PDF.  When `type="application/rss+xml"` or `type="application/atom+xml"`, it points to a syndicated feed (like [RelFeedAttribute rel=feed]).
