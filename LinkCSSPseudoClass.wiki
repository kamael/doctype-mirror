#labels about-css

== Usage ==
{{{
a:link {
   color: red;
}
/* This turns any unvisited link in your page red. */

/* Note that this is redundant code, as simply referencing a{} without the :link pseudo-class will also change its :link property by default, as such: */

a { color: red; }

/* This code has the same effect as the code above. */
}}}
