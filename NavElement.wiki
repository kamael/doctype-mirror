== Usage ==

The `nav` element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a [SectionElement section] with navigation links. Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element -- only sections that consist of primary navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the [FooterElement footer element] is more appropriate in such cases.

In the following example, the page has several places where links are present, but only one of those places is considered a navigation section.
