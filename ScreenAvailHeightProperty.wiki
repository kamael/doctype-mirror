== Values ==

The `screen.availHeight` property returns an integer.

All browsers support this property uniformly.  They calculate the available height by taking the total screen height and subtracting any space used by "always on top" taskbars (on Windows), panels (on Linux), and menubars (on Mac OS X).  Another way to look at it is the maximum height of the browser window, including the window border, window caption, browser menu, browser toolbars, and scroll bars.

Example: if your screen is 1400 x 1050 pixels and your taskbar is 34 pixels high and is set to "keep the taskbar on top of other windows," then `screen.availHeight` will be `1016`.

This property is read-only.
