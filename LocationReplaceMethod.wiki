[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536712(VS.85).aspx MSDN]: "When a document is replaced, it is also removed from the history object. Moreover, the user interface navigation methods, such as the Back and Forward buttons, will no longer access the URL."

[http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.location#Methods Mozilla Developer]: "The difference from the assign() method is that after using replace() the current page will not be saved in session history, meaning the user won't be able to use the Back button to navigate to it."
